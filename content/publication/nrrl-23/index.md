abstract: Dynamic compression of iron to Earth-core conditions is one of the few ways
  to gather important elastic and transport properties needed to uncover key mechanisms
  surrounding the geodynamo effect. Herein a new machine-learned ab-initio derived
  molecular-spin dynamics (MSD) methodology with explicit treatment for longitudinal
  spin-fluctuations is utilized to probe the dynamic phase-diagram of iron. This framework
  uniquely enables an accurate resolution of the phase-transition kinetics and Earth-core
  elastic properties, as highlighted by compressional wave velocity and adiabatic
  bulk moduli measurements. In addition, a unique coupling of MSD with time-dependent
  density functional theory enables gauging electronic transport properties, critically
  important for resolving geodynamo dynamics.
