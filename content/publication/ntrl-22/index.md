abstract: Computational tools to study thermodynamic properties of magnetic materials
  have, until recently, been limited to phenomenological modeling or to small domain
  sizes limiting our mechanistic understanding of thermal transport in ferromagnets.
  Herein, we study the interplay of phonon and magnetic spin contributions to the
  thermal conductivity in $$backslashalpha$$-iron utilizing non-equilibrium molecular
  dynamics simulations. It was observed that the magnetic spin contribution to the
  total thermal conductivity exceeds lattice transport for temperatures up to two-thirds
  of the Curie temperature after which only strongly coupled magnon-phonon modes become
  active heat carriers. Characterizations of the phonon and magnon spectra give a
  detailed insight into the coupling between these heat carriers, and the temperature
  sensitivity of these coupled systems. Comparisons to both experiments and ab initio
  data support our inferred electronic thermal conductivity, supporting the coupled
  molecular dynamics/spin dynamics framework as a viable method to extend the predictive
  capability for magnetic material properties.
