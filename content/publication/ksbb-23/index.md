abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification systems
  are often susceptible to noise interruption, i.e., minor image noise may significantly
  impact the outcome. On the contrary, classical Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is known
  for handling noisy data due to the stochastic and temporal behaviour of the spiking
  neuron signals. However, it is not always feasible to train the weights of the classical
  SNN due to stochastic and non-differentiable spiking signals. Recent applications
  of quantum machine learning to stochastic modelling have predicted that quantum
  computing would prove to be a significant advantage, hence catapulting the study
  of quantum and neuromorphic computing to a new level of development. Motivated by
  these observations, this paper introduces a shallow hybrid classical--quantum spiking
  feedforward neural network referred to as Spiking Quantum Neural Network (SQNN)
  for dealing with a robust image classification task in the presence of noise and
  adversarial attacks. The proposed SQNN offers the inherent capabilities of processing
  unforeseen noisy test images due to its spatial and temporal information. An efficient
  variational quantum circuit training with the help of a standard back-propagation
  algorithm obviates the classical Spiking Time-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and Spike-Prop
  algorithms, which are often found inefficient in training the feedforward SNN. The
  proposed SQNN is extensively tested and benchmarked on the PennyLane Quantum Simulator.
  Experimental results show that the proposed SQNN model supersedes the feedforward
  SNN (SFNN), Random Quantum Neural Networks (RQNN), AlexNet and ResNet-18 on unseen
  test images with added noise from the FashionMNIST, MNIST, KMNIST, CIFAR10, and
  ImageNet datasets.
