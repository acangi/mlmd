abstract: Using a novel ultrahigh resolution ($Δ E ∼ 0.1,$eV) setup to measure electronic
  features in x-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) experiments at the European XFEL in
  Germany, we have studied the collective plasmon excitation in aluminium at ambient
  conditions, which we can measure very accurately even at low momentum transfers.
  As a result, we can resolve previously reported discrepancies between ab initio
  time-dependent density functional theory simulations and experimental observations.
  The demonstrated capability for high-resolution XRTS measurements will be a game
  changer for the diagnosis of experiments with matter under extreme densities, temperatures,
  and pressures, and unlock the full potential of state-of-the-art x-ray free electron
  laser (XFEL) facilities to study planetary interior conditions, to understand inertial
  confinement fusion applications, and for material science and discovery.
