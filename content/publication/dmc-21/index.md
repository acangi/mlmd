abstract: The electronic structure in matter under extreme conditions is a challenging
  complex system prevalent in astrophysical objects and highly relevant for technological
  applications. We show how machine-learning surrogates in terms of neural networks
  have a profound impact on the efficient modeling of matter under extreme conditions.
  We demonstrate the utility of a surrogate model that is trained on emphab initio
  quantum Monte Carlo data for various applications in the emerging field of warm
  dense matter research.
