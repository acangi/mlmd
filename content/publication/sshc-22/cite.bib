 abstract = {We demonstrate the utility of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as solvers for the non-relativistic, time-dependent Schrödinger equation. We study the performance and generalisability of PINN solvers on the time evolution of a quantum harmonic oscillator across varying system parameters, domains, and energy states.},
