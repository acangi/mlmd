abstract: We demonstrate the utility of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as
  solvers for the non-relativistic, time-dependent Schrödinger equation. We study
  the performance and generalisability of PINN solvers on the time evolution of a
  quantum harmonic oscillator across varying system parameters, domains, and energy
  states.
