abstract: Recent studies have been spurred on by the promise of advanced quantum computing
  technology, which has led to the development of quantum computer simulations on
  classical hardware. Grover's quantum search algorithm is one of the well-known applications
  of quantum computing, enabling quantum computers to perform a database search (unsorted
  array) and quadratically outperform their classical counterparts in terms of time.
  Given the restricted access to database search for an oracle model (black-box),
  researchers have demonstrated various implementations of Grover's circuit for two
  to four qubits on various platforms. However, larger search spaces have not yet
  been explored. In this paper, a scalable Quantum Grover Search algorithm is introduced
  and implemented using 5-qubit and 6-qubit quantum circuits, along with a design
  pattern for ease of building an Oracle for a higher order of qubits. For our implementation,
  the probability of finding the correct entity is in the high nineties. The accuracy
  of the proposed 5-qubit and 6-qubit circuits is benchmarked against the state-of-the-art
  implementations for 3-qubit and 4-qubit. Furthermore, the reusability of the proposed
  quantum circuits using subroutines is also illustrated by the opportunity for large-scale
  implementation of quantum algorithms in the future.
