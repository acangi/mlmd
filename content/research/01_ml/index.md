We develop the Materials Learning Algorithms (MALA), a physics-informed machine learning framework that accelerates conventional density functional theory simulations.

Using neural networks, MALA efficiently computes the electronic structure of matter, enabling accurate determination of energies and forces that are critical for atomistic simulations.

MALA is a scalable method that balances accuracy and speed, overcoming the limitations of conventional density functional theory simulations.

It combines the scalability of atomistic simulations with the high accuracy of first-principles methods, paving the way for electronic structure calculations at unprecedented length and time scales. This advancement in materials modeling opens up a broad range of potential applications.
