We develop advanced density functional methodologies for modeling both static and dynamic material properties. This includes creating novel exchange-correlation approximations for ground-state density functional theory (DFT), and applying time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) for dynamic phenomena. We also integrate artificial intelligence techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of our DFT approaches.
