Our research group uses advanced computational methods to design sustainable materials for various applications, such as energy storage devices, thermoelectrics, spintronics, neuromorphic devices, and semiconductor modeling. We utilize scalable machine learning frameworks to improve density functional theory simulations, connect microscopic and mesoscopic simulations, and model advanced material properties. Our techniques incorporate artificial intelligence to enhance efficiency, enabling us to study phenomena as diverse as magneto-structural phase transitions in ultrafast magnetic memory devices and electron transport in nanoscale electronics.
