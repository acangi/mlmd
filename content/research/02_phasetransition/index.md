We bridge the divide between atomistic simulations at the microscopic scale and material simulations at the mesoscopic scale. 
By combining high-fidelity data generation with machine-learning models, we create interatomic potentials for high-performance molecular-spin dynamics simulations. This methodology couples lattice degrees of freedom with electronic spins. We utilize this method for tackling a wide range of applications, including the analysis of material strength, the investigation of transport properties in nanoscale systems, and the simulation of magneto-structural phase transitions relevant for developing ultrafast magnetic storage devices.
