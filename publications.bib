We show how machine-learning surrogates in terms of neural networks have a profound impact on the efficient modeling of matter under extreme conditions. We demonstrate the utility of a surrogate model that is trained on \emph{ab initio} quantum Monte Carlo data for various applications in the emerging field of warm dense matter research.},

	abstract = {Computational tools to study thermodynamic properties of magnetic materials have, until recently, been limited to phenomenological modeling or to small domain sizes limiting our mechanistic understanding of thermal transport in ferromagnets. Herein, we study the interplay of phonon and magnetic spin contributions to the thermal conductivity in {\$}{\$}{\backslash}alpha{\$}{\$}-iron utilizing non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. It was observed that the magnetic spin contribution to the total thermal conductivity exceeds lattice transport for temperatures up to two-thirds of the Curie temperature after which only strongly coupled magnon-phonon modes become active heat carriers. Characterizations of the phonon and magnon spectra give a detailed insight into the coupling between these heat carriers, and the temperature sensitivity of these coupled systems. Comparisons to both experiments and ab initio data support our inferred electronic thermal conductivity, supporting the coupled molecular dynamics/spin dynamics framework as a viable method to extend the predictive capability for magnetic material properties.},

@article{KSBB23,
	abstract = {Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification systems are often susceptible to noise interruption, i.e., minor image noise may significantly impact the outcome. On the contrary, classical Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is known for handling noisy data due to the stochastic and temporal behaviour of the spiking neuron signals. However, it is not always feasible to train the weights of the classical SNN due to stochastic and non-differentiable spiking signals. Recent applications of quantum machine learning to stochastic modelling have predicted that quantum computing would prove to be a significant advantage, hence catapulting the study of quantum and neuromorphic computing to a new level of development. Motivated by these observations, this paper introduces a shallow hybrid classical--quantum spiking feedforward neural network referred to as Spiking Quantum Neural Network (SQNN) for dealing with a robust image classification task in the presence of noise and adversarial attacks. The proposed SQNN offers the inherent capabilities of processing unforeseen noisy test images due to its spatial and temporal information. An efficient variational quantum circuit training with the help of a standard back-propagation algorithm obviates the classical Spiking Time-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and Spike-Prop algorithms, which are often found inefficient in training the feedforward SNN. The proposed SQNN is extensively tested and benchmarked on the PennyLane Quantum Simulator. Experimental results show that the proposed SQNN model supersedes the feedforward SNN (SFNN), Random Quantum Neural Networks (RQNN), AlexNet and ResNet-18 on unseen test images with added noise from the FashionMNIST, MNIST, KMNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.},

@article{KGBS22,
	abstract = {Classical Random Neural Networks (RNNs) have demonstrated effective applications in decision making, signal processing, and image recognition tasks. However, their implementation has been limited to deterministic digital systems that output probability distributions in lieu of stochastic behaviors of random spiking signals. We introduce the novel class of supervised Random Quantum Neural Networks (RQNNs) with a robust training strategy to better exploit the random nature of the spiking RNN. The proposed RQNN employs hybrid classical-quantum algorithms with superposition state and amplitude encoding features, inspired by quantum information theory and the brain's spatial-temporal stochastic spiking property of neuron information encoding. We have extensively validated our proposed RQNN model, relying on hybrid classical-quantum algorithms via the PennyLane Quantum simulator with a limited number of \emph{qubits}. Experiments on the MNIST, FashionMNIST, and KMNIST datasets demonstrate that the proposed RQNN model achieves an average classification accuracy of $94.9\%$. Additionally, the experimental findings illustrate the proposed RQNN's effectiveness and resilience in noisy settings, with enhanced image classification accuracy when compared to the classical counterparts (RNNs), classical Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), and the classical convolutional neural network (AlexNet). Furthermore, the RQNN can deal with noise, which is useful for various applications, including computer vision in NISQ devices. The PyTorch code (this https URL) is made available on GitHub to reproduce the results reported in this manuscript.},

@article{VKSK22,
	abstract = {Recent studies have been spurred on by the promise of advanced quantum computing technology, which has led to the development of quantum computer simulations on classical hardware. Grover's quantum search algorithm is one of the well-known applications of quantum computing, enabling quantum computers to perform a database search (unsorted array) and quadratically outperform their classical counterparts in terms of time. Given the restricted access to database search for an oracle model (black-box), researchers have demonstrated various implementations of Grover's circuit for two to four qubits on various platforms. However, larger search spaces have not yet been explored. In this paper, a scalable Quantum Grover Search algorithm is introduced and implemented using 5-qubit and 6-qubit quantum circuits, along with a design pattern for ease of building an Oracle for a higher order of qubits. For our implementation, the probability of finding the correct entity is in the high nineties. The accuracy of the proposed 5-qubit and 6-qubit circuits is benchmarked against the state-of-the-art implementations for 3-qubit and 4-qubit. Furthermore, the reusability of the proposed quantum circuits using subroutines is also illustrated by the opportunity for large-scale implementation of quantum algorithms in the future.},

	abstract = {Dynamic compression of iron to Earth-core conditions is one of the few ways to gather important elastic and transport properties needed to uncover key mechanisms surrounding the geodynamo effect. Herein a new machine-learned ab-initio derived molecular-spin dynamics (MSD) methodology with explicit treatment for longitudinal spin-fluctuations is utilized to probe the dynamic phase-diagram of iron. This framework uniquely enables an accurate resolution of the phase-transition kinetics and Earth-core elastic properties, as highlighted by compressional wave velocity and adiabatic bulk moduli measurements. In addition, a unique coupling of MSD with time-dependent density functional theory enables gauging electronic transport properties, critically important for resolving geodynamo dynamics.},

	abstract = {Using a novel ultrahigh resolution ($\Delta E \sim 0.1\,$eV) setup to measure electronic features in x-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) experiments at the European XFEL in Germany, we have studied the collective plasmon excitation in aluminium at ambient conditions, which we can measure very accurately even at low momentum transfers. As a result, we can resolve previously reported discrepancies between ab initio time-dependent density functional theory simulations and experimental observations. The demonstrated capability for high-resolution XRTS measurements will be a game changer for the diagnosis of experiments with matter under extreme densities, temperatures, and pressures, and unlock the full potential of state-of-the-art x-ray free electron laser (XFEL) facilities to study planetary interior conditions, to understand inertial confinement fusion applications, and for material science and discovery.},
